# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

In this Homework we were asked to read and do our own tutorial on a regex problem, I chose the URL regex problem. I uploaded pictures and my gist is up and running as well, I used the one they gave us in the starter code and did not need to create my own. The gist is flexible and easy to read with my pictures bringing the reader to the relative component when clicked on. I liked this HW as it gave me a better insight into how regex' work and why they are important although they may look messy.
